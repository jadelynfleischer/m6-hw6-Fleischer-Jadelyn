            Howdy! My name is Jadelyn Fleischer, but I go by Jadie. I am a fourth-year masters student at the University of Florida. I graduated this past August also from the University of Florida with my advertising degree.
            I have a very unique appreciation for what it means to be a Florida Gator. I grew up in a small, rural town in Northern Pennsylvania, where attending college was a luxury that a lot of students did not get to experience. Like many others from my area, my father was not able to attend college and was actually the first male in his family to even graduate from high school. I am beyond grateful that I get to start a legacy for my family that not only includes higher education, but a top five public university as well. I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to get involved in, but I knew exactly who I wanted to be. I wanted to be someone who did the most she could for students in her community and University. Look through my portfolio and resume to see how I accomplished this!
